While the costs of building and maintaining a wind turbine are falling as technology improves, they are still relatively pricey. Also, similar to solar panels, wind turbines are inconsistent, relying on good wind speeds. Despite this, wind turbines still make for a hopeful alternative to other non-renewable energies."

While the building cost of a hydro dam is expensive, maintenance is much cheaper. In addition, no greenhouse gasses are emitted through this form of energy production. However, hydro dams are environmentally damaging due to their reliance on own a flowing water source. "

Also, oil can be converted into electricity when it is burned. As a hydrocarbon, a compound of hydrogen and carbon, oil releases carbon dioxide and soot when it is burned, contributing to climate change. Oil plants are the cheapest to maintain and operate compared to other non-renewable options. However, like coal, the supply for oil is limited. "

The production of natural gas releases less pollutants and greenhouses gases compared to other non-renewable energies. While natural gas plants lead to relatively better overall air quality, they still release a sizable amount of carbon dioxide. Even so, they have cheaper maintenance costs than coal plants"

        desc: "(Non-Renewable Energy) Nuclear power plants use nuclear fission, or the splitting of atoms, in order to create electricity. In doing so, nuclear plants produce a lot more energy than any other energy source. Nuclear plants produce no greenhouse gases, but instead have environmentally damaging nuclear waste. The lifetime of nuclear power plants are long. Although the waste is little, the waste itself takes an extremely long time to decay and is hard to efficiently dispose of."
